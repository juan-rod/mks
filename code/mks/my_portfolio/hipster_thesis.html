    <h1>Hipsters</h1>

    <p class="first">By Harsh Patel</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Hipster is a term popularly used to denote a contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"> subculture</a> in North America, South America, Australia, and Europe primarily consisting of Millennials living in urban areas.[1] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[2] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), progressive, independent, or far-left political views, organic or artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[3][4][5] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.[6][7]</p>

    <h3>What the Heck is a Hipster</h3>

    <p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[8] being derived from the term used to describe earlier movements in the 1940s.[9] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[6][10] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.</p>
